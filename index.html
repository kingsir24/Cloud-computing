    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="155-adolf-hitler.jpeg" alt="Profile Photo">
    <p>Hello! I am Adolf Hitler, a former German soldier and politician who led the Nazi Party and became Chancellor of Germany in 1933. I am known for my leadership during World War II and my role in the Holocaust, which resulted in the deaths of six million Jews and millions of other victims from various groups.</p>

  <section id="ideology">
    <h2>My Ideology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Antisemitism:</strong> I believe that Jewish people are inferior to Aryans and pose a threat to the German race. My policies aimed to systematically persecute and eventually eliminate the Jewish population.</li>
      <li><strong>Nazism:</strong> Nazism is a form of extreme nationalism combined with elements of racism and totalitarianism. It promotes the belief in a master race and advocates for the subjugation or elimination of perceived inferior races.</li>
      <li><strong>Worldview:</strong> I envision a world dominated by the Aryan race, with Germany at the helm. This includes the conquest of Eastern Europe to create a vast German living space (Lebensraum).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="achievements">
    <h2>My Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rise to Power:</strong> In 1933, I was appointed Chancellor of Germany after the Nazi Party gained a majority in the Reichstag. I then assumed dictatorial powers and began the systematic dismantling of democratic institutions.</li>
      <li><strong>World War II:</strong> In 1939, I invaded Poland, marking the beginning of World War II. Throughout the war, I implemented a policy of brutality and terror against civilians and prisoners of war, particularly targeting Jewish people, Romani people, disabled individuals, LGBTQ+ individuals, and political opponents.</li>
      <li><strong>The Holocaust:</strong> The systematic murder of six million Jewish people, along with millions of other victims, is my most notorious achievement. This genocide was carried out through concentration camps, ghettos, mass shootings, and medical experiments.</li>
    </ul>
